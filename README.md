# PacBio-merge
Merge report files from PacBio tools

If you are using a version of CCS more recent than 5.0, please use of the
new json report as input. These can be generated by specifying `--report-json`
to CCS.

## Legacy mode
Prior to CCS release v5.0.0, PacBio tools reported tools report summary
statistics of the following format:
```
ZMWs input          (A)  : 47
ZMWs generating CCS (B)  : 22 (46.81%)
ZMWs filtered       (C)  : 25 (53.19%)

Exclusive ZMW counts for (C):
Median length filter     : 0 (0.00%)
Below SNR threshold      : 0 (0.00%)
Lacking full passes      : 20 (80.00%)
Heteroduplex insertions  : 0 (0.00%)
Coverage drops           : 0 (0.00%)
Insufficient draft cov   : 0 (0.00%)
Draft too different      : 0 (0.00%)
Draft generation error   : 0 (0.00%)
Draft above --max-length : 0 (0.00%)
Draft below --min-length : 0 (0.00%)
Reads failed polishing   : 0 (0.00%)
Empty coverage windows   : 0 (0.00%)
CCS did not converge     : 0 (0.00%)
CCS below minimum RQ     : 5 (20.00%)
Unknown error            : 0 (0.00%)
```

In cases where PacBio tools such as `CCS` are run in scatter mode, a report is produced for every individual scatter.
To get a full picture of the statistics that have been produced by `CCS`, these report files have to be merged back together.
This tool parses the content of the PacBio report files into json, and can output the merged and original files in both json and PacBio format.
Currently, only the counts are supported, while the percentages are left out.

## Usage
```bash
usage: pacbio_merge [-h] --reports REPORTS [REPORTS ...] [--json-output JSON_OUTPUT] [--PacBio-output PACBIO_OUTPUT]
                    [--write-input-json WRITE_INPUT_JSON]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --reports REPORTS [REPORTS ...]
                        PacBio reports to merge
  --json-output JSON_OUTPUT
                        Write the merged data in json format to this file
  --PacBio-output PACBIO_OUTPUT
                        Write the merged data in PacBio report format to this file
  --write-input-json WRITE_INPUT_JSON
                        Write the input files to json
  --legacy              Parse legacy PacBio log files (prior to CCS V5.0.0)

```
